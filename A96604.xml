            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>COurteous and kind Reader, I muſt conſeſſe that divers learned men have taken much pains in tranſlating ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry books, containing moſt wholeſome and profitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Phyſick and Chyrurgery, wherein they have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at large declared all ſuch things as ſeemed neceſſary and expedient in Phyſick, to be known in our Native and mother Tongue, to the intent, that every one that would but take the pains to peruſe them, and make tryall of them, might benefit themſelves, and do much good to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friends.</p>
            <p>To the ſame intent and purpoſe, I have collected this ſmall (though beneficiall Treatiſe) I have thought fit to write ſomething in the behalf and praiſe thereof, finding many rare experimented medicines, which (put in practiſe) may prove beneficiall to ſtudious and carefull Practiſioners, and I doubt not but they may gain much credit and applauſe, both by their practiſe, and by their cure (if they pleaſe to put them in practiſe) which will be little expence unto them, though great credit and benefit.</p>
            <p>There are many curious Medicaments therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and divers of them approved by famous Phyſitians of good eſteem: And therefore deſire all who affect their healths, to make uſe of ſuch medicines as they ſhall find ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the preſervation thereof: as alſo, for ſuch as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the recovery of ſuch as are ſick and weak, being confident by Gods aſſiſtance, that much happineſſe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to ſuch as make tryall of them.</p>
            <p>And to the end, that this little volume might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeable, but eſtimable and beneficiall to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England; I have thought fit to write thus much in the praiſe thereof, wiſhing good ſucceſſe in its progreſſe, and to all that ſhall peruſe and practiſe on it; and to all Students, Practitioners, and well wiſhers to Phyſicall practiſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:169740:3"/> that their ſtudies, labours, and practiſes may alwaies be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull and proſperous, to the honour and glory of God, the good of the Common-wealth, the benefit of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and to their perpetuall fame and renown; and therefore do wiſh that every one of them would uſe all care to ſpend ſome part of their ſtudy, how to benefit the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, knowing the ſaying of <hi>Cicero (non ſolùm nobis nati ſumus)</hi> but to be helpfull to our friends and ſtrangers, which is moſt commendable. This I conceive ſhould invite all well-wiſhers to the generall good, to imitate the example of divers learned Phiſitians, who have not only cured divers out of charity, but alſo left moſt famous pieces of Phiſick and Chyrurgery printed in Engliſh, for the good of all that will take the pains to read them, and practiſe on their labours. And certain I am, that many by their care and induſtry fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their preſcriptions, have gained much benefit, and great eſteem thereby, and though ignorant in Phiſick, or the practiſe thereof, became Practitioners, and famous by others labours and indeavours, and ſucceſſefull alſo in what they undertook. I hope the ſame happineſſe will befall ſuch as will take the pains and care in reading this Treatiſe, and likewiſe make trial of the medicaments herein contained, which is and ſhall be deſire and prayer of</p>
